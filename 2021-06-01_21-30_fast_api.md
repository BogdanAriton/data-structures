# FAST API

## What is FAST API?
It's a framework that allows you to create APIs in very easy fashion and the APIs created are responsive.
The best thing about FAST API is that it will generate documentation for the API that can be used by front end to build the correct requests.

## What kind of APIs can we build?
The API itself will be build based on the HTTP REST interface (CRUD operations like: GET, POST, PUT(UPDATE), DELETE).

## Is FAST API fast?
Here is a paper the benchmarks FAST API Against Flask and Django: https://dev.to/fuadrafid/fastapi-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-20ob
FAST API is considered to be at par with Node and Go.

## How to build an API using FAST API?
Here is a great tutorial by TechTim that show how to use PATH Params and Query Params on all CRUD operations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ykeT6kk4bk
What Tim isn't showing this tutorial are async calls that are offered by FAST API out of the box.
Async calls are covered best here: https://stackabuse.com/python-async-await-tutorial
There is also a good article from Toptal on securing your API: https://www.toptal.com/python/build-high-performing-apps-with-the-python-fastapi-framework

## Is FAST API production ready?
YES! FAST API is production ready with great documentations support and easy to use interface (referring to the great documentation output)
